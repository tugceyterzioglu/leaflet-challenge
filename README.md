# Leaflet Challenge: Earthquake Visualization

This project visualizes earthquake data using **Leaflet.js** and the **USGS GeoJSON Feed**. The interactive map displays earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths with dynamically styled markers and a legend.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: Displays earthquake data across the globe.
- **Dynamic Markers**: 
  - **Size** reflects earthquake magnitude.
  - **Color** reflects earthquake depth (e.g., deeper earthquakes are redder).
- **Legend**: Provides a clear key for interpreting marker colors based on depth ranges.
- **Popups**: Display detailed information about each earthquake, including:
  - Magnitude
  - Depth
  - Location

## Data Source
- Earthquake data sourced from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
